# MY NETWORK: Responding to the Coronavirus
<br><i>This project was sourced from my friends, family, and fellow students. In this time of crisis, communication adn connection are essential needs, but the inability to be with one another in person due to the risk of infection means that those needs (among many others) are unmet.</i><br> <br>
<i>Each of the entries are a response by an anonymous participant. </i><br><br><br>

        <h5> Entry 1: How am I feeling? </h5>
            <p> I am feeling a mixture of emotions. They change from moment to moment and day to day. Worried. Calm. Stressed. Relaxed. Appalled. Distracted. Sad. Entertained. Disappointed. Focused. Vulnerable. Proud. Insignificant. Loved. Devastated. Hopeful. <br><br>Coronavirus has made me more appreciative of the small, simple things in life — going out to eat, working on my computer in a café, having a game night with friends. It has also made me realize just how many aspects of life as we know it are inessential and non-guaranteed. I feel more connected to all of humanity than ever since this is a uniquely shared experience. <br><br>I am predicting that it will take awhile to return to any sense of normalcy. I think, and hope, that people will have a newly found appreciation for many things, including just the opportunity to be alive. I think that everyone who endured this will be forever influenced by this, in some way or another. I am looking forward to spending time with my family and friends and traveling. </p> <br>
            <h5> Entry 2: Things Have Been Rough </h5>
            <p> After having to have emergency surgery in this craziness, having my 7 year old constantly has been a struggle as well. Financially we aren’t stressed out because Tim is an essential worker. Life has not changed, not really, besides having my son home at all times. <br><br>In the future I am hoping that we learn from this and are more medically equip for issues like this in the future. But I think that some of the changes are good. Pollution in the air is clearing up, at national parks animals are repopulating. I am most looking forward to spending time with friends and family again with our worry.<br><br>
 </p>
        <h5> Entry 3: Hope for a Return to Normal </h5>
            <p> Honestly, I'm annoyed. I know the virus is nothing to take lightly, but it's annoying to see hours reduced at stores, not being able to shake hands, not be able to get toilet paper, etc. <br><br>How has it changed my life/perspective? I feel that it hasn't really changed my perspective much. I do wonder sometimes if this is what it's like to live in a small town that doesn't get a lot of shipments in to stock what I would normally consider essential. It's changed my life in the way that I cannot prospect to people for real estate. I am an in person solicitator and I'm good at it. I'm not very good at trying to solicitator business digitally. <br><br>I predict that it will last longer than anyone anticipates. And that digital communication will become more of a norm. Those that are introverted will become more so because they have figured out a way to do so. And delivery will become even bigger than it was before. <br><br>Really, I'm looking forward for it to end. I would like to be able to see my friends and family without much lashback. I look forward to a vaccine so that we CAN go back to normal. And I look forward to seeing how it changes the world and how the world operates.</p><br>
        <h5> Entry 4: Bombard Our Communities </h5>
            <p> I'm feeling tressed, not financially, but stressed for my children. They love going to daycare, and we just started to have LPS come out for visits for my daughter. To help her and us teach her! In all honestly the virus hasn’t changed my perspective on life, besides, now I feel I’m home to do more projects I’ve wanted to finish, but my day revolves around my children. <br><br>It may be months at hand, but I’m hoping a vaccine is created, and well have a little COVID parade and bombard our favorite restaurants and movie theaters, and tell our family and friends we love them more. <br><br>I'm looking forward to my kids going back to daycare, and I can’t wait to have someone more professional help us in the world of Autism. And a normal sleep routine for everyone, waking up at 2 am the last few nights with a child is exhausting!
</p>
        <h5> Entry 5: There is Hope </h5>
            <p>The sun is shining, the birds are singing, a warm cat is snuggled next to me.  For a moment, just a moment, all is well with the world. And then I remember. And then I look at my phone. And then I wonder how my family, all in different places, I wonder if they are alright.  Are they sick? Is it allergies? Have they been careful? Are they washing their hands? Are they wearing their masks? Are they limiting going out in public? <br><br>
Sleep? Sleep is treacherous, unpeaceful, stacchato.  A sinkhole of anxiety ridden thoughts, dreams, terrors.  Who will succomb? Will it be someone in my family? Will it be me? Will I have time to write and compose, not only a makeshift will, but my love for my children on paper?  Will I be able to convey just how much they mean to me, just how much I do not want to leave before my time? <br><br>
There are many ways to die.  I realize that death is inevitable.  But to die alone, to die suffering, to die without holding your loved one’s hand, to die without saying goodbye, to die and have your body placed in a semi-truck piled along with the others, stacks upon stacks, no funerals, just the end.  This is not the way any of us would hope to end. <br><br>
Hope.  There is hope.  There is Hope.  There are people helping others, there is music, there are brave and tireless healthcare workers, grocery store workers, restaurant workers, volunteers and many more.  There is hope in the earth healing.  Will we survive? Will we learn from this passage in history? Only Time will reveal that answer.  And I, I hope selfishly, that my family and I will see that future.
