            <p> In order to discuss how and why surveillance capitalist companies such as Google/Apple/etc. lok to the future (of tech, of their wealth), Zuboff turns to discussing "economics of scale" and "economies of action." Starting with scope, Zuboff writes: "The shift toward economies of scope defines a new set of aims: behavioral surplus must be vast, but it must also be varied. These variations are developed along two dimensions. The first is the extension of extraction operations from the virtual world into the “real” world, where we actually live our actual lives." (201) The second dimension economies of scope occur in is "depth;" Zuboff writes: "The idea here is that highly predictive, and therefore highly lucrative, behavioral surplus would be plumbed from the intimate patterns of the self," like moods, personality, and vulnerabilities (201). In other words, the two important economies of scope are 1) extension into unknown territory to expand the region/availability of data, and 2) plumbing deeper into already available entry points, like the mind of its users.</p>

            <p> For the second part of her analysis in this chapter, Zuboff focuses on "economies of action," which she describes as the process of machines being "configured to intervene in the state of play in the real world," or, in other words, machines working to "nudge, tune, herd, manipulate, and modify behavior in specific directions by executing actions as subtle as inserting a specific phrase into your Facebook news feed..." (201). This moves an online world into the real -- what Zuboff calls a "reality business," wherein machine-based architectures now have impact on the real world. Zuboff calls this the "execution architecture," a structure by which "economic objectives are imposed upon the vast and varied field of behavior" (202). </p>

            <p>I think that I am reading this right: "Because the apparatus of connected things is intended to be everything, any behavior of human or thing absent from this push for universal inclusion is dark: menacing, untamed, rebellious, rogue, out of control." (210) Or, in other words--any data that cannot be catalogued, any behaviors that are "unseen," are considered "dark data." This would indicate that "dark data" is potentially even dangerous in its invisibility; I think this sentiment plays on the paranoia of the populace.</p>

            <p> "From the vantage point of surveillance capitalism and its economic imperatives, world, self, and body are reduced to the permanent status of objects as they disappear into the bloodstream of a titanic new conception of markets." (212) Objects as in flat data, but also objects as in no longer human; this reduces the feeling of immorality when manipulating/taking advantage of behavior.</p>

            <p> After a long example of her point on economies of scope and action via auto insurance companies, Zuboff summarizes her argument with the following: "Drivers are persuaded, induced, incentivized, or coerced into a quid pro quo that links pricing to the expansion of a real-world extraction/execution architecture aimed at new behavioral surplus flows... surplus drawn from the driver's experience is repurposed as the means to shape and compel the driver's experience for the sake of guaranteed outcomes" (218). In other words, drivers will modify their behavior intentionally in order to lower their personal costs by aligning with the preferences/rules of the company, which in effect serves to benefit the insurance company. </p>

            <p>"This is not the automation of society, as some might think, but rather the replacement of society with machine action dictated by economic imperatives." (221) Good quote.</p>
